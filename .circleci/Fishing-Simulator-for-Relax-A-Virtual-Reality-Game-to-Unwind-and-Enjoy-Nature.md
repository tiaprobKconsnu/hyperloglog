But Fishing Simulator for Relax is more than just a game. It is also a relaxing and therapeutic activity that can help you reduce stress, anxiety, and depression. By using a VR headset and headphones, you can fully immerse yourself in the sights and sounds of nature, such as the water, the birds, the wind, and the fish. You can also listen to soothing music or guided meditation while you fish. You can even interact with other players online and chat with them about fishing or anything else.
 
Fishing Simulator for Relax is available for Windows PC and compatible with Oculus Rift, HTC Vive, Valve Index, and Windows Mixed Reality headsets.

One of the best features of Fishing Simulator for Relax is the realistic and dynamic weather system. You can fish in different weather conditions, such as sunny, cloudy, rainy, snowy, or foggy, and see how they affect the fish behavior and the water physics. You can also adjust the time of day, from dawn to dusk, and enjoy the changing colors of the sky and the water. You can even fish at night and use a flashlight or a lantern to see better.
 
Another great feature of Fishing Simulator for Relax is the variety and complexity of the fish AI. The fish in the game are not just static objects that you can catch easily. They have different personalities, preferences, and behaviors, depending on their species, size, and mood. They can be shy, curious, aggressive, or playful, and they can react to your actions and the environment. They can also swim in schools, chase each other, or hide under rocks or plants. You have to use your skills and strategy to lure them and catch them.
 
Fishing Simulator for Relax is not only a game for fishing enthusiasts. It is also a game for anyone who loves nature and wants to experience it in a new and immersive way. Whether you want to relax, have fun, or learn something new, Fishing Simulator for Relax can offer you a satisfying and rewarding experience.
