However, finding the Secret Series books in print or online can be challenging, as they are not as widely available as Blyton's other works. Some of the books have been reprinted or revised over the years, while others have been out of print for decades. Moreover, some of the books have different titles or editions depending on the country or publisher. For example, the fourth book in the series, The Secret of Killimooin, was retitled as The Secret Forest in some editions. A sixth book in the series, The Secret Valley, was not written by Blyton herself, but by Trevor J. Bolton and published by Award in 2009.
